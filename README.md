# FBSentimentAnalysis
Python script to build a basic sentiment analysis model trained on nltk sample_tweets dataset. The model is the used on scraped FB messages from my account.

This script was written in Jupyter Labs.

## To use it on your own messages:

1. Download your message history from Facebook. Facebook Settings -> Your Facebook Information -> Download your information -> Select messages.
2. Navigate to the folder in which you saved the message data and locate the file location of the messages you wish to scrape.
3. Replace the url variable with your file location in the 'Scrape the facebook messages' section.
4. Run the script!
